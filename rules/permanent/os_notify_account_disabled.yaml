title: "Notify of account disabling actions"
discussion: |
  When operating system accounts are disabled, user accessibility is affected. Accounts are utilized for identifying individual operating system users or for identifying the operating system processes themselves.To detect and respond to events that affect user accessibility and system processing, operating systems must audit account disabling actions and, as required, notify System Administrators and ISSOs so they can investigate the event. Such a capability greatly reduces the risk that operating system accessibility will be negatively affected for extended periods of time and also provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication_access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
