title: "Notify of account created actions"
discussion: |
  Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply create a new account. Notification of account creation is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail, which documents the creation of operating system user accounts and notifies System Administrators and ISSOs that it exists. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication_access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
