title: "Disable TouchID Prompt during Setup Assistant"
discussion: |
  The prompt for TouchID during Setup Assistant _MUST_ be disabled.

  MacOS prompts new users through enabling TouchID during Setup Assistant; this is not essential and, therefore, _MUST_ be disabled to prevent against the risk of individuals electing to enable TouchID to override organization-wide settings.
