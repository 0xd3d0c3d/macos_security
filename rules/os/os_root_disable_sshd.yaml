title: "Disable Root login for remote connections"
discussion: |
  The macOS system must require individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator. Administrator users must never log in directlty as root. To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, logging in as root over a remote connection must be disabled. Administrators shall only run commands as root after first authenticating with their individual accounts.

  NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.
