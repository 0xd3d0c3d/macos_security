title: "Shutdown, restart, or notify when anomalies in the security functions are discovered"
discussion: |
  If anomalies are not acted upon, security functions may fail to secure the system. Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.This capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart the information system upon security function anomaly detection.
