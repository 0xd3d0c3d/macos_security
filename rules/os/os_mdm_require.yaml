title: "Enforce Enrollment in Mobile Device Management"
discussion: |
  You _MUST_ enroll your Mac in a Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.
  
  User Approved MDM (UAMDM) enrollment or enrollment via Apple Business Manager (ABM)/Apple School Manager (ASM) is required to manage certain security settings. Currently these include:
  * Whitlisting Approved Kernel Extensions
  * Privacy Preferences Policy Control Payload
  * ExtensibleSingleSignOn
check: |
  /usr/bin/profiles status -type enrollment | /usr/bin/awk -F: '/MDM enrollment/ {print $2}' | /usr/bin/grep -c "Yes (User Approved)"
result:
  integer: 1
fix: |
  Ensure that system is enrolled via UAMDM.
