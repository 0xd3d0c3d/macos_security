title: "Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Special Character"
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one special character be used when a password is created.

  Special characters are those characters that are not alphanumeric. Examples include: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ *.
  
  This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users.
check: | 
  /usr/bin/profiles -P -o stdout | /usr/bin/awk '/minComplexChars/{sub(/;.*/,"");print $3}'
result:
  integer: 1
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
