title: "Prohibit Password Reuse for a Minimum of Five Generations"
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a password history of at least five previous passwords when a password is created. 

  This rule ensures that users are  not allowed to re-use a password that was used in any of the five previous password generations. 

  Limiting password reuse protects against malicious users attempting to gain access to the system via brute-force hacking methods.
check: | 
  /usr/bin/profiles -P -o stdout | /usr/bin/awk '/pinHistory/{sub(/;.*/,"");print $3}'
result:
  integer: 5
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
