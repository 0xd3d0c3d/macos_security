title: "Disable Media Sharing"
discussion: |
  Media sharing _MUST_ be disabled.

  When Media Sharing is enabled, the computer starts a network listening service that shares the contents of the userâ€™s music collection with other users in the same subnet. 

  The information system _MUST_ be configured to provide only essential capabilities. Disabling Media Sharing helps prevent the unauthorized connection of devices and the unauthorized transfer of information. Disabling Media Sharing mitigates this risk.

  NOTE: Even if the user enables this service, the firewall is configured to block access to it. See Firewall Supplemental which includes a script that has an example policy to implement this rule.
