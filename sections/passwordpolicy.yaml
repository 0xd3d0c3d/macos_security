  name: "Password Policy"
  description: |
    This section contains the configuration and enforcement of settings pertaining to password policies in macOS.

    NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section _MUST_ be run by a user with elevated privileges. 

    NOTE: The settings outlined in this section adhere to the recommendations provided in this document for systems that utilize passwords for local accounts. If systems are integrated with a directory service, local password policies should align with domain password policies to the fullest extent feasible.

    [IMPORTANT]
    ====
    Until National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 revision 5 is officially published, the password policy recommendations used to develop these rules  fall under NIST SP 800-53 revision 4. NIST SP 800-53 revision 4 was released with the guidance published in NIST SP 800-63 at the time, however, NIST SP 800-63 has been revised a number of times since then. At this time, the recommendation is for organizations to adopt the newer published guidance defined in NIST SP 800-63.
